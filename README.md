# Survey Project

This week we will be practicing React state and controlled forms by making a Typeform-like product. The completed project should consist of at least 3 questions that need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

### The Problem

I started by building the Form component, marking out where the other components where supposed to go later on. Then, one by one, continued to build up the app.
If I had more time I would definitely go for the advanced stretch goals, but this week I just ran out of time.
