# Survey Project

This week we will be practicing React state and controlled forms by making a Typeform-like product. The completed project should consist of at least 3 questions that need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

### The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

### View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
